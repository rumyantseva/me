## Getting started with application observability

### Short description
Observability - one of the key properties for modern applications. Typically, when we talk about it, we mean logs, metrics, and traces. However, according to the definition, observability is a measure that shows our ability to understand the current state of the system or any component of the system. In this workshop, we will see how applications themselves can contribute to observability of the whole system.

### Details
We will discuss the importance of observability and the role of application in building observable systems. During the workshop, we will focus on practical examples and cases. We will start with an application that doesnâ€™t provide any observability and will see how to improve the situation step-by-step. At the end of the workshop, our application will achieve a significantly better level of observability. The ideas and techniques of this workshop are applicable to different tools but for simplicity, we will use DataDog to analyze the data. If you would like to work with your own code, feel free to bring it to the workshop. Otherwise, you will be provided with a typical web service.

### Workshop plan
- Observability oveview
- Three main states of application: starting, stopping, running
- The concept of application performance management
- Error and panic handling
- Logging levels and how they might help
- Log message format and useful tags
- Logger performance. How to choose the right tool?
- Traces and metrics, the OpenTelemetry (OpenTracing + OpenCencus) project and its current state
- How much data we might need?
- Distributed tracing techniques
- What we can measure inside the application?
- How to test metrics locally?
- How to analyze the data we collected?
- Practical observability analysis with DataDog


### Prerequisites
- Source code examples will be provided in Go, some basic knowledge of the Go programming language is expected
- If you would like to join this workshop as a participant, you need to install:
  - A stable version Go (the latest stable version is recommended)
  - An IDE or editor to be able to write in Go
  - Docker Community Edition (as a part of the workshop, we are going to work with containers)
- During the workshop, we will also install and set up some additional tools and libraries
